Objective:  
1. We aim to construct a SVR based formalism to predict non-bonded interaction energy in clusters and condensed phases. 
2. We develop this method based on a combination of SVR and many body expansion (MBE) of interaction energies. 
3. We have tested the scheme of exact SVR predictions for water dimer and trimer energies in case of rigid water molecules. 
4. We have employed this formalism to compute the interaction energies of decamers of rigid water molecules and checked the accuracy of predictions against the QM estimates. 

Starting point: 
The conÔ¨Åguration space of water decamer cluster is obtained from two separate classical NVT simulations at 100K and 300K, 
using Gromacs software. In this work we are examining the rigid clusters only.  
Equally spaced 452 snapshots of water decamer are taken from the combined NVT simulation trajectory. 
This gro file is the starting point of the codes: "" and "". 
In these two codes, we generate the all possible dimer and trimer data
